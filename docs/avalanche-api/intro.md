# Avalanche

Avalanche (AVAX) is an open-source, decentralized, and highly scalable blockchain platform designed for decentralized applications (DApps) and enterprise blockchain deployments. It offers a unique consensus mechanism called the Avalanche Consensus Protocol (ACP), enabling millions of validators to participate in the network. This results in extremely fast transaction speeds and low fees. Avalanche's compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) makes it easy for developers to port their existing Ethereum DApps to Avalanche. The platform also supports subnets, which are independent blockchain networks that can be customized to meet the specific needs of a particular application or organization. Avalanche's rapidly growing ecosystem includes a wide range of DApps, tools, and services.
