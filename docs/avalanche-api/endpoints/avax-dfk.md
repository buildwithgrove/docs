# Avalanche DFK

`avax-dfk`

DeFi Kingdoms is a cross-chain, play-to-earn game built on a strong DeFi protocol with plans to become a fully-fledged MMORPG in later phases of the Roadmap. The game features DEXs, liquidity pool opportunities, and a market of rare, utility-driven NFTs, which all together create a beautiful, immersive online world in the incredibly nostalgic form of fantasy pixel art. DeFi Kingdoms: Crystalvale lives on DFK Chain, an Avalanche subnet.
