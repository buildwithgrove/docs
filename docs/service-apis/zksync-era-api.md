# zkSync Era

zkSync is a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, offering fast, secure, and low-cost transactions by leveraging zero-knowledge proofs. By moving transactions off the Ethereum mainnet onto zkSync's layer 2 solution, users can enjoy increased throughput and reduced fees while maintaining the security guarantees of the Ethereum blockchain. With zkSync, developers can build scalable decentralized applications (dApps) without compromising on decentralization or security.
