# Polygon Amoy Testnet

`polygon-amoy-testnet`

Introducing the Amoy Testnet for Polygon PoS, a new Sepolia-anchored testnet providing developers with a low-stakes environment for experimentation. As Ethereum moves forward, so does Polygon PoS, adapting to ensure sustainability and continuity for developers. With Amoy utilizing Sepolia as its root chain, developers can rely on essential validators, infrastructure, faucets, and tools in a future-proof environment. Grove is proud to offer Amoy Testnet support with Archival access, ensuring developers can access all block heights for comprehensive testing and development.
