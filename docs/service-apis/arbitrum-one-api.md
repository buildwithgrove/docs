# Arbitrum One

Arbitrum One is a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that enhances its capabilities by improving its transaction speed and reducing costs, while inheriting the security model of Ethereum. Arbitrum operates on top of Ethereum as a separate layer, enabling faster and more cost-effective transactions. This makes it an ideal choice for applications that require high throughput and more efficient gas usage.
