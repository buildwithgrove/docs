# Optimism

Optimism is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, aiming to enable high-speed, low-cost transactions while maintaining a strong connection with the Ethereum network. The Optimism Supported Methods give developers the ability to interact with the Optimism network in a range of ways, including querying balances, executing transactions, and interacting with smart contracts.
