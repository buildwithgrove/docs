# Pocket Network

Pocket Network is a decentralized infrastructure protocol dedicated to empowering developers with access to reliable, performant, and cost-effective data. With a focus on open data and infrastructure ownership, Pocket Network serves as a universal RPC infrastructure, enabling developers to seamlessly access data from over 50 blockchain networks through its decentralized network of operators. With Grove, developers can easily connect to Pocket Network's infrastructure, reducing friction and facilitating innovation. The platform's roadmap emphasizes continuous improvement, with upcoming upgrades aiming to further decentralize access and enhance the network's capabilities.
