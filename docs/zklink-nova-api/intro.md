# zkLink Nova

zkLink Nova is the industry’s first aggregated Layer 3 zkEVM Rollup network built on top of Ethereum and Ethereum Layer 2 rollups (L2s). zkLink Nova is an EVM-compatible, open platform for simple and fast smart contract development of any kind. zkLink Nova’s platform allows for scattered assets across Ethereum Layer 2s to be aggregated for interoperable trade and transaction. zkLink Nova is secured by zero-knowledge proof technology, charges extremely low gas costs, offers fast finality, and inherits its security from Ethereum.
