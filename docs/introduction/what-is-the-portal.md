# What is the Portal?

The Portal acts as a gateway to [Pocket Network's](https://www.pokt.network/) decentralized RPC protocol, allowing developers to easily leverage Pocket's tens of thousands of globally distributed nodes for reliable RPC service.

Developers can create (“mint”) blockchain network endpoints for use in their applications, taking advantage of the dozens of different blockchains supported in the Portal. Portal users can also monitor network performance and configure custom security features around their endpoints.

In this way, the Portal provides similar functionality to more centralized API services, all while delivering [reliable, optimized performance](https://www.blog.pokt.network/rpc-service-and-the-rpc-trilemma/) and retaining the [decentralization](https://www.blog.pokt.network/demystifying-rpc-nodes-why-decentralization-matters/) that Pocket Network is built on.
