# Latency: Setting the Standard

At Grove API, we take pride in delivering some of the industry's quickest response times. This exceptional speed is made possible through our cutting-edge Node Selector logic, a proprietary technology that seamlessly integrates with our network of 17 regions and the decentralized POKT Network. When a request is initiated, our Node Selector actively identifies the swiftest available nodes relative to your application's location, ensuring that you receive the fastest possible response.

## Efficient Caching Solutions

Unlike many companies that resort to caching requests and responses to achieve low latency, Grove excels in maintaining rapid response times without the need for extensive caching. Our Node Selector functionality operates with such efficiency that caching becomes unnecessary, allowing us to consistently provide remarkably fast responses.

## Benchmarking Made Easy

We encourage you to compare Grove API with any other provider of your choice using third-party benchmarking tools. To facilitate this comparison, here are a few reputable options:
