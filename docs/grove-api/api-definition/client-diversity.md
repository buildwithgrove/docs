# Embracing Decentralization through Client Diversity

At Grove, our commitment to decentralization is unwavering. Decentralization takes on various meanings in different contexts, and one crucial aspect is Client Diversity. This diversity serves as a protective shield against security vulnerabilities that could jeopardize entire blockchain networks while fostering a robust and varied developer ecosystem.

We actively endorse and empower our Suppliers to deploy their services on the client of their choice, aligning with the principles set forth by the Ethereum Foundation, as outlined at [clientdiversity.org](https://clientdiversity.org/). Consequently, within our core API documentation, you will find support exclusively for methods that adhere to industry-standard practices across different clients.

If you are currently reliant on a client-specific library, we encourage you to contemplate broadening your horizons and contributing to our mission of decentralization. You can achieve this by either adopting client-standard RPC calls or actively participating in enhancing the functionality of other clients to support your preferred SDKs. Together, we can fortify the foundations of decentralization and promote a more resilient blockchain ecosystem.
