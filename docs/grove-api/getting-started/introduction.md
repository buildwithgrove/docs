# Grove API

The Grove API has been built to be the performance layer on top of decentralized protocols and enable the handshake between application developers and any Application Programming Interface. As the first Gateway on the decentralized [Pocket Network](https://pokt.network), we are focus on providing our customers with enterprise level quality and metrics on the Pocket Network to enable a fast and reliable service.

## Quality on a Decentralized Network

At Grove we believe strongly that in the future all traffic will resolve on a decentralized network. Decentralized networks, like the Pocket Network, do a fantasic job at enabling anyone to be a supplier which provides an unstopable source of RPC access and redundancy to all developers.

However, there are some challenges that come with decentralization, such as quality and consistency. Since anyone can become a provider, users could get many different responses to the same request. At Grove, our focus lies in simplifying the complexities of a decentralized market and giving our developers the tools needed to get the best of web3 and web2.

We are passonate about developer experience and bringing the next wave of developers into the web3 world.

## The Future

We are always looking towards the future, and we are very excited. We see a world where more and more relays are resolved on decentralized networks. We see a world with some amazing new developers and projects working on bringing decentralization to more than just RPC. And we see a world where Grove can help normalize and simplify the expereince of developers across these markets.
