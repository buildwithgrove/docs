# Client Diversity

At Grove we believe in a decentralized world. With decentralization also comes diversification, and client diversity is something we feel strongly about. We actively support and encourage our node runners to deploy on any client they want. As such you will see in our core API docs that we only support methods that all standard clients support.

We feel that decentralization can only occur
