# Client Diversity

At Grove we believe in Decentralization. Decentralization means many things in many different contexts. Client Diversity is an important aspect of Decentralization in order to avoid security vulnerabilities to entire blockchain networks and a healthy and diverse developer ecosystem.

We actively support and encourage our Suppliers to deploy on any client they want in conjunction with the views of the Ethereum Foundation https://clientdiversity.org/. As such you will see in our core API docs that we only support methods that are standard across clients.

If you're currently using a client-specific library, we encourage you to consider branching out and aiding in our mission of Decentralization by either using client-standard RPC calls or contributing to other clients to enhance their functionality to support your favorite SDKs.
