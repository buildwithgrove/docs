# Latency & Caching

## Latency

The Grove API has some the industries fastest response times. We are able to achieve this through our proprietary [Node Selector](/grove-api/getting-started/quality-of-service) logic. The Node Selector works in combination with our 17 regions and the decentralized [POKT Network](https://pokt.network). When a request comes in, we actively find the fastest nodes available to your applications location, ensuring your request is the fastest result possible.

## Caching

Many companies have to cache requests and responses in order to match the low latency that the Grove API is able to achieve. The [Node Selector](/grove-api/getting-started/quality-of-service) functionality works so well that at Grove we do not need to cache request in order to provide extermely fast responses.
