# Ethereum Mainnet

`eth-mainnet`

This is the primary Ethereum network where real-world transactions and DApps operate. It provides near-head support for the latest blocks (up to 127 blocks behind the current one), ensuring developers have access to up-to-date blockchain information. This chain is ideal for applications that require immediate and accurate blockchain data, with a high transaction throughput and real-time data access.
