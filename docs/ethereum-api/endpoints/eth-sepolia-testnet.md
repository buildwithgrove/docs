# Ethereum Sepolia Testnet

`eth-sepolia-testnet`

Sepolia is a testnet for the Ethereum blockchain, designed as an environment where developers can test their decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts under conditions that closely resemble the main Ethereum network. This testnet is particularly useful for those looking to ensure compatibility, perform stress tests, and refine user experience in a controlled setting, facilitating a smoother transition to the mainnet deployment. Following the deprecation of older testnets like Ropsten, Sepolia has become more prominent in Ethereum's testing landscape, offering a modern and maintained platform for development and testing purposes.
