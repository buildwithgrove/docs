# Ethereum Rinkeby

`rinkeby`

Another testnet variant, Rinkeby offers a sandbox for developers to test Ethereum DApps and smart contracts. It uses a different consensus mechanism (proof-of-authority) compared to the main Ethereum network, providing a controlled environment for experimentation and testing.
