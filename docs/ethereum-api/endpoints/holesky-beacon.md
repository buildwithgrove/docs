# Ethereum Holesky Beacon

`holesky-beacon`

The Holesky Beacon Chain serves as Ethereum's premier testing ground, offering developers a fee-free and focused environment to fine-tune their decentralized applications (dApps) before deploying them onto the main Ethereum network. Launched to address the challenges of on-chain congestion and high gas costs, Holesky replaces Ethereum's previous testing environment, Goerli, with enhanced features and capabilities. Named after Prague's Nádraží Holešovice subway station, Holesky introduces increased validator capacity, a robust staking mechanism, and preparations for Ethereum's upcoming major upgrade, Dencun. With a substantially higher fixed supply of testnet tokens and improved token issuance system, Holesky aims to overcome the limitations faced by Goerli, providing developers with a more reliable and scalable testing infrastructure.
