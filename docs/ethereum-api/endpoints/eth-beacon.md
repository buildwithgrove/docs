# Ethereum Beacon

`eth-beacon`

The Beacon Chain serves as the cornerstone of Ethereum 2.0, introducing the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism and facilitating scalability and efficiency enhancements within the Ethereum blockchain. Launched in 2020 alongside Ethereum's existing proof-of-work (PoW) chain, known as Eth1 or the Ethereum Mainnet, the Beacon Chain marks a significant step toward a more sustainable and scalable future for Ethereum. Its transition to PoS addresses key concerns such as energy consumption, decentralization, and scalability, offering a more eco-friendly, inclusive, and efficient approach to blockchain consensus. The Beacon Chain's functionalities include consensus management, validator coordination, and chain linking, ensuring seamless operation and integration with Ethereum's broader ecosystem.
