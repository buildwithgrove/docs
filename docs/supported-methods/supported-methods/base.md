# Base

Base is an open-source, decentralized, and highly scalable blockchain platform designed for decentralized applications (DApps) and enterprise blockchain deployments. The platform offers a unique consensus mechanism called the Avalanche Consensus Protocol, which enables millions of validators to participate in the network. This results in extremely fast transaction speeds and low fees. Its compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) facilitates easy porting of existing Ethereum DApps to Base. Additionally, Base supports subnets, which are independent blockchain networks customizable to meet the specific needs of a particular application or organization. The rapidly growing ecosystem of Base includes a wide range of DApps, tools, and services.

## Chain Relay IDs for Supported Methods

Each blockchain we support has a specific Portal API prefix and RelayChainID, which are integral parts of our supported methods functionality. These are used to correctly route and process requests. For both the Base and Base Testnet blockchains, both Archival and Non-Archival requests are supported. Developers can use a singular Endpoint for accessing both Archival and Non-Archival data. This simplifies the process and ensures that you have access to comprehensive blockchain data without needing to switch between different Endpoints.

| Blockchain   | Portal API Prefix | RelayChainID | Blockheight       |
|--------------|-------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Base Mainnet | base-mainnet      | 0079         | All block heights |
| Base Testnet | base-testnet      | 0080         | All block heights |


## Archival and Non-Archival Support

For both the Base and Base Testnet blockchains, both Archival and Non-Archival requests are supported. Developers can use a singular Endpoint for accessing both Archival and Non-Archival data. This simplifies the process and ensures that you have access to comprehensive blockchain data without needing to switch between different Endpoints.
