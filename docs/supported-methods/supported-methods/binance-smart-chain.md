# Binance Smart Chain

Binance Smart Chain (BSC) is an open-source, decentralized, and highly scalable blockchain platform, tailored for decentralized applications (DApps) and enterprise blockchain deployments. As a fork of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), BSC is fully compatible with Ethereum-based DApps. This compatibility offers significant advantages, such as faster transaction speeds and lower fees compared to Ethereum. BSC is renowned for its thriving ecosystem, which hosts a diverse range of DApps, positioning it as a valuable resource for users in the blockchain space.

## Chain Relay IDs for Supported Methods
Each blockchain we support has a specific Portal API prefix and RelayChainID, which are integral parts of our supported methods functionality. These are used to correctly route and process requests. For Binance Smart Chain we support Archival nodes. If you are accessing data from 128 blocks or earlier, please ensure to use `bsc-archival`. This allows you to query historical data while also ensuring optimal performance. The supported methods for the archival chains are identical to their non-archival counterparts.

| Blockchain | Portal API Prefix | RelayChainID | Blockheight |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Binance Smart Chain | `bsc-mainnet` | 0004 | Latest - 127 blocks |
| Binance Smart Chain (Archival) | `bsc-archival` | 0010 | 128 blocks + |


## Supported Methods
Supported methods are API functions specific to a given blockchain, enabling interaction with its distinct features. The following is a comprehensive list of our supported methods, along with brief descriptions to understand their purpose and functionality:
