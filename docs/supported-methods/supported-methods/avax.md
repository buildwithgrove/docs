# AVAX

Avalanche is an open-source, decentralized, and highly scalable blockchain platform designed for decentralized applications (DApps) and enterprise blockchain deployments. It offers a unique consensus mechanism called the Avalanche Consensus Protocol (ACP), which enables millions of validators to participate in the network, resulting in extremely fast transaction speeds and low fees. Avalanche's compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) makes it easy for developers to port their existing Ethereum DApps to Avalanche. The platform also supports subnets, which are independent blockchain networks that can be customized to meet the specific needs of a particular application or organization. Avalanche's rapidly growing ecosystem includes a wide range of DApps, tools, and services.

## Chain Relay IDs for Supported Methods
Each blockchain we support has a specific Portal API prefix and RelayChainID, which are integral parts of our supported methods functionality. These are used to correctly route and process requests.

| Blockchain | Portal API Prefix | RelayChainID |
