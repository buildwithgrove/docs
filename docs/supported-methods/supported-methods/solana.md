## Solana on Grove

Solana is a high-performance blockchain platform designed for the development of decentralized applications (dApps). It's known for its high throughput and scalability, making it a popular choice for developers looking to build fast and efficient blockchain-based solutions.

## Supported Chain Variants

Grove supports both the standard and custom nodes of Solana:

### Solana Mainnet

`solana-mainnet`

The standard node, optimized for high-performance transactions and real-time data queries on the Solana blockchain.

### Solana Custom

`solana-mainnet-custom`

Solana Custom is Grove and Pocket Network's custom flavor of the Solana Blockchain that provides enhanced historical and indexing capabilities for users while limiting the hardware and infrastructure requirements of Node Suppliers.

See [Solana Custom](#solana-custom-api) for more information.
