# Moonriver

Moonriver, a companion network to Moonbeam, operates as a permanently incentivized canary network. This Ethereum-compatible smart contract platform is particularly suited for developers seeking to test and deploy early versions of their projects in a real-world environment. The Moonriver supported methods provide a wide range of functionalities for developers, including querying account balances, executing transactions, and interacting with smart contracts.

The design of Moonriver closely mirrors Moonbeam, offering a familiar environment for developers already acquainted with the Ethereum ecosystem, but with the added benefit of being a space for early testing and development.
