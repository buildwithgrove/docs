# Chain Variants

In the multifaceted world of blockchain technology, different types of network nodes and environments play distinct roles. Each variant has unique characteristics and applications, making them indispensable in various blockchain-related scenarios.

## Archival Nodes

Archival Nodes store the entire history of a blockchain, including all transactions and states (balances, contract code, storage, etc.) at every block. They are essential for developers and businesses needing access to comprehensive historical blockchain data, particularly for auditing, compliance, or in-depth analysis. Archival nodes differ from full nodes, which only store the most recent state, and light nodes, which hold limited data. Running an archival node requires significant storage and computational resources.

**Use Case**

A financial institution conducting a thorough audit of blockchain transactions over several years for compliance with regulatory standards.

---

## Ethereum Trace

Ethereum Trace offers detailed insights into the execution of transactions on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It details every step, including function calls, state changes, and gas usage. Ethereum Trace is crucial for debugging smart contracts and understanding detailed Ethereum transaction processes.

**Use Case**

A developer debugging a complex smart contract to optimize its performance and gas efficiency, by analyzing each function call and state change.

---

## Mainnet Nodes

Mainnet Nodes connect to the primary, live blockchain network. They are used for executing real transactions and interact directly with the actual blockchain environment. Mainnet nodes are critical for applications that require interaction with the blockchain in a production environment.

**Use Case**

A decentralized application (dApp) operating on the Ethereum mainnet, facilitating real-time cryptocurrency transactions and smart contract executions.

## Testnet Nodes

Testnet Nodes link to a test blockchain network, providing a sandbox for developers to test and experiment in an environment that simulates the mainnet without risking actual-value transactions. They are invaluable for development and testing before deployment.

**Use Case**

A development team testing a new blockchain-based voting system on a testnet to ensure security and functionality before launch.

---

## Solana Custom Nodes

Solana Custom Nodes are specifically designed for the Solana ecosystem. They offer tailored functionalities and interactions within this network, catering to the unique features and requirements of Solana.

**Use Case**

A gaming platform built on the Solana blockchain utilizing custom nodes for fast, low-cost transactions and scalable dApp interactions.
