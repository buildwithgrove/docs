# Archival Nodes

Archival nodes, also known as archive nodes, are a type of node in a blockchain network that stores the entire history of the blockchain, including all states (balances, contract code, storage, etc.) for every block. They are different from full nodes, which only store the most recent state of the blockchain, and light nodes, which only store a small subset of the blockchain data.

## What is an Archival Node?

An archival node is a node that maintains a complete and full record of a blockchain's transaction history. These nodes store every transaction that has ever occurred on the blockchain, as well as the current state of all smart contracts, balances, and data stored in the blockchain. This is in contrast to a full node, which only maintains the state of the blockchain from the most recent 128 blocks.

Archival nodes are essential for developers and businesses that need to access historical blockchain data. For example, if a developer wants to know the state of a contract at a specific block in the past, they would need to query an archival node. Similarly, businesses that need to comply with regulatory requirements for data retention may also rely on archival nodes.

## Why Use an Archival Node?

Archival nodes provide several benefits:

1. **Historical Data Access**: Archival nodes allow for querying the state of the blockchain at any given block height. This is useful for developers who need to debug transactions that occurred in the past or analyze the historical state of a smart contract.

2. **Audit and Compliance**: For businesses and organizations that need to maintain a complete record of all transactions for audit or compliance purposes, running an archival node is necessary.

3. **Network Support**: By running an archival node, you are supporting the blockchain network by providing a source of historical data for others.

However, running an archival node also comes with its challenges. They require a significant amount of storage space, as they store every transaction and state change that has ever occurred on the blockchain. As of 2023, an Ethereum archival node requires over 7TB of storage. They also require more computational resources to maintain and query the large amount of data.

## Archival Nodes vs Full Nodes

The main difference between an archival node and a full node lies in the amount of data they store. While both types of nodes validate and relay transactions, a full node only stores the most recent state of the blockchain, while an archival node stores the entire history of the blockchain.

Here's a comparison of the two:

| | Archival Node | Full Node |
|---|---|---|
| **Data Stored** | Entire history of the blockchain, including all past states. | Most recent state of the blockchain (last 128 blocks for Ethereum). |
| **Storage Requirements** | High (over 7TB for Ethereum as of 2023). | Moderate (around 1TB for Ethereum as of 2023). |
| **Use Cases** | Accessing historical data, audit and compliance, network support. | General use, wallet services, smart contract interaction. |

## Summary

Archival nodes play a crucial role in the blockchain ecosystem by providing access to the complete history of the blockchain. While they require more resources to run than full nodes, they are invaluable for developers needing historical data and businesses requiring audit trails. As blockchain technology continues to evolve, the role of archival nodes will likely become even more important.
