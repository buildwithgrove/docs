# Fraxtal

Fraxtal is a cutting-edge, modular rollup blockchain (Layer 2) with a vision for "fractal scaling" to enhance blockchain scalability. It operates as an EVM-equivalent, utilizing the OP stack for fast, secure, and cost-effective application deployment, much like other leading Ethereum rollups such as Optimism and Base. Unique to Fraxtal is its modular design, which supports the development of additional Layer 3 solutions and the integration of diverse chains and networks. Fraxtal also introduces an innovative incentive mechanism called Flox, rewarding users and developers with FXTL points—convertible into tokens—for using and interacting with the network. The native gas token, Frax Ether (frxETH), is issued by Frax Finance, completing its robust ecosystem designed to streamline user experience and developer engagement.
