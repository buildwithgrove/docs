# Gnosis

Gnosis Chain is a fast, Ethereum-compatible network designed for secure and low-cost transactions with a robust Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. It serves as an eco-friendly platform tailored for decentralized applications that require fast finality and operates with a strong emphasis on community governance. Utilizing Gnosis Chain supported methods, developers can leverage the platform for a variety of actions such as querying account balances, initiating transactions, and engaging with smart contracts, all while benefiting from reduced gas costs and enhanced transaction speed.
