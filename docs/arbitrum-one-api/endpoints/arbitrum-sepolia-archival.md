# Arbitrum Sepolia Archival

`arbitrum-sepolia-archival`

Arbitrum Sepolia is a testnet chain that replicates the features of the Arbitrum One mainnet. It is tethered to the Sepolia testnet of Ethereum, providing a secure testing ground for developers to experiment with. Utilizing optimistic rollup technology, Arbitrum Sepolia offers a testing landscape where developers can fine-tune their decentralized applications prior to mainnet deployment, guaranteeing both compatibility and efficient performance within a Layer 2 framework.
