# Optimism BNB

`op-bnb-archival`

opBNB is a Layer 2 scaling solution specifically designed for the BNB Smart Chain, utilizing the Optimism OP Stack's bedrock version to enhance transaction efficiency and resource management. This network significantly reduces the load on the BNB Smart Chain by processing transactions off-chain while still anchoring data to the mainnet. Users can seamlessly transfer funds from BSC to interact with applications and execute contracts on opBNB. The system relies on sequencers to aggregate and process transactions, provers to generate cryptographic proofs ensuring transaction validity, and verifiers to confirm the integrity of the opBNB state. With its high throughput and low fee structure, opBNB effectively extends the capabilities of the BNB Smart Chain, offering an elevated user experience and greater scalability through its advanced Layer 2 technology.
