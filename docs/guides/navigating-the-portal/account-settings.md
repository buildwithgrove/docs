Navigating the Grove platform efficiently requires familiarity with your account settings, the control hub where you manage your organizational preferences. Here, we'll guide you through each component of the Account Settings, ensuring you can tailor your Grove interaction to fit your project's needs and team dynamics perfectly.

## Account Avatar

While customization is not available at this moment, your avatar plays a key role in helping team members quickly identify and align themselves with your organization within Grove.

## Account Name
Change your account name by clicking the "Change Name" button. A popup will allow you to enter a new name. Providing a clear and recognizable account name is crucial as it enhances the experience for other team members by making it easy to associate their work and contributions with the right organization. A well-chosen name fosters a sense of belonging and clarity, ensuring that all team members are aware of the organization they are a part of and can easily navigate within the Grove ecosystem.

## Account ID

## Members
