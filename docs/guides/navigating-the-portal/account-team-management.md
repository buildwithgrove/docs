# Team Management

Efficient team management is pivotal for the smooth operation and security of your Grove applications. The "Members" section is designed to facilitate the easy assignment of roles and the setting of permissions for your team. By meticulously managing team roles and permissions, you can maintain a secure and efficient workflow within Grove, ensuring each team member has the access they need to contribute effectively to your projects.

## Navigating to Team Members

To oversee your team within the Grove Portal:

1. Select "Settings" from the left-hand navigation menu.
2. Click on the "Members" tab to view all team members. By default, if no members have been invited yet, you'll be listed as the sole owner.

## Inviting a New Member

Expanding your team is straightforward: 

1. Click the "Invite New Member" button found within the "Members" section.
2. In the ensuing pop-up window, input the invitee's email address.
3. Choose an appropriate role (Admin or Member) from the dropdown menu for the new member.
4. Hit "Invite" to dispatch the invitation email, which prompts them to join your team on the Grove.
