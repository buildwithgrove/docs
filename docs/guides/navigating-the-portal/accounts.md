# Portal Accounts
Your Portal account is the command center of Grove. From here, you manage your organization, your team, and your plan—everything you need to keep projects running smoothly at scale.

## Account Name
Your account name is your organization’s identity in the Portal. Keep it clear and recognizable—so teammates can quickly align their work with the right org. Change it anytime by hitting “Change Name.” A strong name builds clarity, trust, and belonging across your team.

## Account ID
Every organization has a unique, permanent ID (e.g. `a1b2c3d4`). This ID is the backbone of your Grove identity—used for coordination, billing, and security across the platform.

## Team Management 

### Account Members
Your team lives inside the Members tab in Account Settings. By default, you’ll start as the sole Owner. From here, you can see everyone in your org and manage roles.

### Inviting a Member
Growing your team is simple:
1. Click “Invite New Member.”
2. Enter their email.
3. Assign a role: Admin or Member.
4. Hit Invite and we’ll send them a join link.

### Roles and Permissions
Detailed roles and permissions ensure effective team collaboration and operational security.
