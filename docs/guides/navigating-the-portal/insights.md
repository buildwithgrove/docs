# Insights
**Insights are Grove‚Äôs observability layer** ‚Äî giving you the clarity to monitor performance, usage, and reliability across every level of your infrastructure. Whether you‚Äôre running a single dApp or an entire suite of services, Insights let you see the big picture and drill into the details, all within the Portal.

## üî≠ The Hierarchy of Insights
Grove organizes Insights along the same structure as the Portal:
- **Account Insights** ‚Äî the organizational view, aggregating activity across every Application.
- **Application Insights** ‚Äî a focused view of how a single Application is performing.
- **Logs** ‚Äî the most granular layer, where data flows in from each individual RPC endpoint.

This hierarchy makes it seamless to move from **macro ‚Üí micro**: start with your account‚Äôs overall health, zoom into a specific application, and troubleshoot down to a single endpoint.

## üìä Account Insights
**The big picture**. Account Insights aggregate all activity across your organization.
- Total relay volume across all Applications on your Account
- Performance trends by network, chain, or endpoint
- Compare Applications
- Monitor usage against plan limits
**Use it for**: operations, planning, budgeting, and understanding how your team‚Äôs projects add up at scale.

## ‚ö° Application Insights
**The zoom-in view**. Application Insights show how a single app is performing in the network.
- Request volume, latency, and reliability for that app
- Trends over time to optimize performance
**Use it for**: debugging, performance tuning, and ensuring reliability for mission-critical apps.

## üìù Logs
For granular debugging, **Logs** extend Insights into a request-by-request audit trail:
- **Relay Records** ‚Äî view each request sent through Grove.
- **Errors & Failures** ‚Äî trace failed calls and diagnose causes.
- **Audit Trail** ‚Äî maintain full transparency for compliance and QA.
**Use it for**: precise troubleshooting or when you need to analyze a specific service connection.

:::tip Logs: Your Debugging Lens
Within Application Insights, the Logs tab gives you a request-by-request view of activity.
- Track every relay sent through Grove
- Pinpoint errors, failures, or slow responses
- Maintain a complete audit trail for compliance and QA
**Think of Logs as the microscope inside Insights** ‚Äî where you move from patterns to precision.

## ‚úÖ Best Practices
- **Start wide** ‚Üí check Account Insights for overall usage and anomalies.
- **Drill down** ‚Üí move into Application Insights when issues appear.
- **Drop into Logs** ‚Üí use request-level data for root-cause debugging.
- **Monitor continuously** ‚Üí set alerts for relay thresholds and latency changes.

### Why It Matters
With Grove Insights, you don‚Äôt just see raw data ‚Äî you see **how your infrastructure is performing at every level**. From the health of your organization down to a single RPC call, Insights (and Logs) give you the confidence to build, scale, and operate with precision.
