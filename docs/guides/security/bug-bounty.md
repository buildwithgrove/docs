# Grove's Bug Bounty Program

Grove offers a vulnerability disclosure program, colloquially known as a Bug Bounty Program. We treat Security as a first-class citizen. In addition to our own measures, we are more than happy to accept and reimburse for security suggestions and improvements to our Products.

# TL;DR
We have a bug bounty program that pays up to $2,500 in USDC. The bounty will be valid for all projects owned by Grove. 

# How It Works
Current industry standards utilize the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) v3.1 to calculate the severity of a software vulnerability across multiple dimensions, including impact, exploitability, remediation, etc. We’ve opted to do the same with our bug bounty program. 

At present, our program stands as following: To qualify for a bounty, all reports must be emailed to portal@grove.city and include:

* A write-up summarizing the bug, the steps needed to reproduce it, its impact to Grove, and (optionally) any recommendations to resolve the issue.
* The CVSS v3.1 vector. This can be found on the National Vulnerability Database’s Calculator. An example of this would be AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H.
* A proof of concept, including all code needed to reproduce, with detailed instructions of how to do so.

The maximum total payout is then determined by the CVSS v3.1 score.

* Low (0.1 - 3.9) -> Up to $250 USDC
* Medium (4.0 - 6.9) -> Up to $750 USDC
* High (7.0 - 8.9) -> Up to $1,250 USDC
* Critical (9.0 - 10) -> Up to $2,500 USDC

These payouts represent the maximum amount for a confirmed vulnerability. To receive the full amount, a report will be expected to provide the following:

* Well written submissions that are able to describe the issue and impact to a non-technical audience.
* A well documented proof of concept that allows for easy reproduction of the issue.
* Clear and actionable steps that can be taken to resolve the issue.
* Amounts will be paid in USDC (Ethereum) to a wallet of the Reporter's choosing.
