# MetaMask with Portal

MetaMask is a widely-used Ethereum wallet that allows users to interact with the Ethereum blockchain and Ethereum-based applications directly from their browser. One of the powerful features of MetaMask is the ability to add a custom RPC network, which means you can use Portal as a decentralized Ethereum API.

## Why Use Portal with MetaMask?

Portal offers a unique value proposition for MetaMask users:

- **Decentralization**: By using Portal as your default Ethereum infrastructure provider in MetaMask, you connect to Ethereum in a completely decentralized manner. This ensures that your data is not controlled by a single entity, enhancing the security and privacy of your interactions.

- **Resilience and Redundancy**: The Portal provides built-in redundancy at the protocol level, ensuring maximum uptime and unprecedented resiliency. Even if a node goes offline, your application remains connected to other nodes in the network.

- **Support for Node Operators**: Every action you perform within MetaMask triggers a call, which translates to API requests (relays). These relays are serviced by node operators, who are rewarded for running full nodes. This aligns with the ethos of Web3, creating a more sustainable and equitable digital future.

## How to Use Portal with MetaMask?

Here's a quick guide on how to use Portal with MetaMask:

1. Open MetaMask and click on the Networks drop-down menu, then select Custom RPC.
2. In the Network Name field, enter `Ethereum Mainnet Portal Gateway`.
3. In the New RPC URL field, copy and paste your Ethereum Mainnet Endpoint URL from the Portal.
4. (Optional) Enter `0001` in the ChainID field.
5. (Optional) Enter `ETH` as the Symbol.
6. (Optional) Add `https://etherscan.io` as the Block Explorer URL.
7. Click Save to finish the setup.

By following these steps, you can start using Portal with MetaMask and enjoy the benefits of a decentralized, resilient, and equitable Ethereum infrastructure.
