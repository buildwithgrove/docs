# Welcome to Grove

Welcome to Grove â€“ your gateway to high-performance decentralized web3 infrastructure. At its core, Grove is a RPC (Remote Procedure Call) service that enables users to read and write data to over 40 blockchains. Grove is built on top of Pocket Network, a global, decentralized network of nodes. Through the Portal, Grove provides a performance layer that enhances the reliability and scalability of Pocket while also ensuring the high quality service users demand.

## What Makes Grove Unique?

### ðŸŒŽ **Decentralization**

Grove connects to a network of thousands of nodes, ensuring your data remains free from the control of a single entity. The decentralized nature of the network also encourages node client diversity - widening the scope of the requests that can be served through Grove.

### â›“ **Multi-Chain Support**

Whether youâ€™re building on EVM or non-EVM ecosystems, Grove has you covered. Our ecosystem agnostic approach ensures that you have the tools to build flexible, multi-chain apps.

### ðŸŽ¯ **Reliability and Redundancy**

Groveâ€™s performance layer + Pocketâ€™s decentralized network ensures that your requests will be served by high performing nodes, anytime, anywhere in the world.

### ðŸ“ˆ **Scalability**

Scaling your application isnâ€™t an issue with Grove. We can manage substantial request volumes, guaranteeing uninterrupted performance, even under significant load.

### ðŸš€ **Speed**

Grove is optimized for performance. We support gateways in 17 geographical regions, minimizing the roundtrip latency for a request.

### ðŸª„ **Cost-Effective**

The decentralized network model minimizes infrastructure expenses by distributing costs across participants. Grove promotes a fair distribution of value and cost - pay only for your actual usage with no overage charges or hidden fees.
