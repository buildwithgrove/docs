# Quickstart: Get an endpoint

We streamline the process of connecting to the decentralized web, offering you seamless API interaction right from the start. This quickstart guide is your roadmap to acquiring an endpoint, enabling your projects to communicate with Grove's services effortlessly.

## Public Endpoints (Quick Start)

For immediate testing and development, you can use our **[public endpoints](https://grove.city/public-endpoints)** without any registration:

- **No signup required** - Start making requests immediately
- **Free to use** - Perfect for testing and prototyping
- **Rate limited** - Suitable for development but not production use
- **Shared infrastructure** - Performance may vary based on usage
- **Low priority support** - Support for public endpoints is deprioritized and has no guarantee on service. 

:::warning Rate Limits on Public Endpoints
Public endpoints have rate limits and are shared among all users. For production applications or higher throughput needs, we recommend getting a private endpoint through Grove Portal for guaranteed performance, higher rate limits, and dedicated resources.
:::

If public endpoints meet your needs, you can start making RPC calls immediately. For production applications or when you need higher performance, continue with the steps below to get a dedicated private endpoint.

## Private Endpoint

### Benefits of Private Endpoints:
- **Rate limits** - Make more requests per second
- **Advanced analytics** - Track usage and performance metrics
- **Priority support** - Backed by [Grove SLAs](https://grove.city/sla), Get help when you need it!

### Step 1: Sign Up for Private Endpoints
[Sign up](https://portal.grove.city/api/auth/auth0?signup=true) for a Grove account to create an account.

### Step 2: Account Customization

Give your account a unique name and customize your experience.

### Step 3: Create Your First Application
Creating an application is your first step towards active blockchain interaction.

1. **Navigate:** Click on the 'Create Application' button within the Grove portal.  
2. **Name Your Application:** Assign a name to uniquely identify your application in your account.  
3. **Select an Appmoji:** Choose an Appmoji for a fun, visual representation of your application.  
4. **Describe Your Application:** Provide a concise description to outline your applicationâ€™s functionality and purpose. 

### Step 4: Access Private Endpoints

Utilize your dedicated private endpoints to make RPC calls and interact with various services with higher performance and rate limits.

- Locate the 'Endpoints' section in your application.
- Choose the endpoint corresponding to the service you wish to interact with.
- Copy the endpoint URL for use in your RPC calls.

### Step 5: Make Your First RPC Call

Congratulations! You've successfully set up your Grove account and application.

- Explore the [Grove API](/grove-api/getting-started/introduction.md) for detailed documentation on making specific RPC calls.
