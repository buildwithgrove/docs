# Quickstart: Get an Endpoint

Connecting to the decentralized web shouldn’t feel complicated. Grove makes it effortless—spin up an endpoint in minutes and start streaming data with enterprise-grade speed, scale, and reliability.

## Public Endpoints (Fastest Start)
Want to test right away? Use our [public endpoints](https://www.grove.city/public-endpoints)—no signup, no setup:
- **Instant access** — start making requests now
- **Free to use** — great for testing & prototyping
- **Shared infrastructure** — performance may vary
- **Rate limited** — designed for dev work, not production
- **Community support only** — no SLA or guarantees

:::warning Public Endpoint Limits
Public endpoints are shared across all users and rate-limited. For production workloads, higher throughput, and guaranteed performance, create a private endpoint in Grove Portal.

## Private Endpoints (Production-Ready)
When you’re ready to go live, private endpoints give you the power, reliability, and insights you need.

### Why private endpoints?
- **No rate limits** — handle infinite scale
- **Advanced analytics** — track usage, performance & trends
- **Priority support + SLAs** — enterprise-grade reliability

### Step 1: Sign Up
Create your [Grove account](https://portal.grove.city) in seconds and unlock your own private endpoint.

### Step 2: Personalize Your Account
Claim your namespace, customize your workspace, and get ready to build.

### Step 3: Create Your First Application
Every app starts here:

1. Hit “Create Application” in the Portal.
2. Name it — make it yours.
3. Pick an Appmoji — your app’s visual identity.
4. Add a short description — optional but useful.

### Step 4: Access Your Private Endpoint
- Head to the Endpoints section of your app.
- Select the service you want (EVM, LLM, data API, etc.).
- Copy the endpoint URL into your app.

### Step 5: Make Your First Call 🚀
That’s it—**you’re live**. Your app is now powered by Grove’s decentralized infrastructure.
