# Quickstart Guide

Welcome to the Quickstart Guide for Portal. This guide will walk you through the simple two-step process to get started with using Portal in your application.

## Step 1 – Get an Endpoint

The first step to getting started with Portal is to sign up for the Portal, create an application, and get the endpoint for the chain(s) that you need access to.

For full details of this process, please refer to the [Get an Endpoint](get-an-endpoint) page.

## Step 2 – Plug it into your Application

There are many different reasons why a developer would need to access a blockchain in their application. Your Portal URL is designed to work directly in some of the existing frameworks and libraries that different developers would be interacting with.

### UI and Interface Developers

If you're building an interface to blockchain applications, a collection of examples of how to use your Portal endpoint is available under [Popular Libraries](https://docs.pokt.network/api-docs/).

&rarr; [Go – ethclient](/guides/popular-libraries/ethclient-go)

&rarr; [Java – web3j](/guides/popular-libraries/web3j-java)

&rarr; [JavaScript – ethers.js](/guides/popular-libraries/ethers-js)

&rarr; [Python – web3.py](/guides/popular-libraries/web3-py)

&rarr; [Rust – web3](/guides/popular-libraries/rust-web3)


### Smart Contract Developers

If you're a smart contract developer needing access to live chains in your development environment, a collection of examples of how to leverage your Portal endpoint can be found under `Smart Contract Environments`.

&rarr; [Solidity & Vyper – Truffle](/guides/smart-contract-environments/truffle)

### Interacting Directly with the Chain

If you're looking to access blockchain data directly, but aren't using a framework or library, head over to our interactive [API Documentation](https://docs.pokt.network/api-docs/) to see how to interact directly with the underlying blockchain API, either directly in your browser with your Portal endpoint, or through the code samples provided for each of the different supported requests.

With these steps, you're now ready to start using Portal in your application. Happy building!
