# What is an Account?

With Grove, an account represents your organizational workspace. It's the central hub where your applications, billing, and team collaboration come together. Unlike a personal profile, which is individual-centric, an account is designed to be the operational core for teams and their projects.

- **Manage Applications**: All your applications are organized under your account, providing a consolidated view of your projects.
- **Invite Team Members**: Collaborate efficiently by inviting colleagues to join your account, enabling them to contribute and access the applications.
- **Handle Billing**: Centralize your billing at the account level, making it easier to track expenses, manage subscriptions, and update payment methods.
- **Customize Settings**: Tailor your account settings to fit the unique needs of your organization, including security preferences and notification controls.

Consider your account as the command center for your organization's engagement with our platform. It's designed to simplify your workflow, foster team collaboration, and streamline the management of your projects and financials.
