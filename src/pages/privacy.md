TERMS OF SERVICE
Last Modified: [SEPTEMBER 14, 2023]

**Please read these Terms of Service (the “Terms”) carefully before you start to use this website.**

### Overview and Scope

We, at Grove Redefines Our Very Existence Inc., a Delaware Corporation (Grove Redefines Our Very Existence Inc., “Grove”, “we,” “us,” or “our”), recognize the importance of protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information” or “PII”) collected about you and other visitors (collectively, “Users”). This Policy applies to the PII collected through the Grove website, which includes www.pokt.network, its subdomains, and all of the websites and internet properties owned or operated by us, regardless of the medium by which Grove’s services are accessed by Users (e.g., via a web or mobile browser) (collectively, the “Service”). We are committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. To that end, this Privacy Policy (“Policy”) discloses our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of the PII we receive through Users’ use of the Service. Unless otherwise expressly agreed to in writing, your Personal Information will be processed according to the terms of this Policy. By using the Service, you accept the terms of this Policy.

This Policy is also drafted to comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) (as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”)) and emerging United States (“US”) privacy laws, including the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (“VCDPA”). In addition, this Policy is applicable to data subjects within jurisdictions outside of the U.S., including but not limited to, the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom (collectively, the “EEA”). Therefore, this Policy is drafted to comply with the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and the U.K. GDPR (collectively, the “GDPR”). Users of the Service are under no statutory or contractual obligation, or other obligation to provide PII to us. For the purposes of compliance with the GDPR, we are the data controller of information we collect from data subjects through the Service. For the purposes of this Policy, “data subject” means an identified or identifiable natural person located in the EEA.

### Information We Collect

We are the sole owner of information collected on the Service. We collect several types of information from and about Users of the Service, including:

Personal Information: We may collect PII (i.e., “personal data” under the GDPR) from you when you complete forms, navigate web pages, and in connection with other activities, services, features, or resources we make available on the Service. PII means any information that identifies, relates to, describes, references, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular individual or household. PII does not include publicly available information from government records, deidentified or aggregate information, or information excluded from the scope of the CCPA. We may collect Sensitive PII about you.

The types of PII we have collected, used, stored, and disclosed in the last twelve (12) months include the following categories of information:

### Types of Information — Used Where

‍First Name — App
Last Name — App
Email Address — Blog, Marketing Pages, App
IP Address (via Google Analytics) — Blog, Marketing Pages
Geolocation — Blog, Marketing Pages
Browsing History — Marketing Pages

Deidentified Information: We may collect deidentified information from you and aggregate information that may not by itself reasonably identify you as the source when you navigate the Service (“Deidentified Information”). Deidentified Information may include: (i) device type, (ii) device operating system, (iii) internet browser type, (iv) internet service provider, (v) referring/exit pages, (vi) date/time stamp, and (vii) clickstream information. We will take reasonable measures to ensure that Deidentified Information we collect is not personally identifiable and may not later be easily used to identify you as required by applicable law. We publicly commit to maintain and use the information in deidentified form and not to attempt to reidentify the information, except that we may attempt to reidentify the information solely for the purpose of determining whether its deidentification processes satisfy the requirements of this subdivision.

Children’s Information: We do not offer our services or promote the Service to, nor do we intentionally collect or retain PII from, children who are younger than 18 years of age. If we discover that we have inadvertently collected information from a child under 18 years of age, we will promptly take all reasonable measures to delete such information from our systems.

### How We Collect Information

‍
The information we collect depends on what Users do when they visit or utilize the Service. We collect PII and Deidentified Information in various ways, including:

Directly from You: We collect PII when you voluntarily submit PII to us while completing forms on the Service and in connection with other activities, services, features, or resources we make available on the Service. The PII we collect depends on what you do when you visit or utilize the Service or how you choose to communicate with us.

Through Your Use of the Service: We may collect PII and Deidentified Information that your browser transmits when you visit the Service. We may also collect Deidentified Information about how you access and interact with the Service through the use of automated tracking technologies, such as session cookies, persistent cookies, and web beacons.

A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to an internet browser, which enables the Service to remember and customize your subsequent visits. We may use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate the Service. In particular, we may use session cookies to record session information, such as which web pages you visited and to track your activity on the Service. Session cookies expire when you close your browser. We may also use persistent cookies to track and target your interests to enhance your experience on the Service. Persistent cookies remain on your device for an extended period of time. Additionally, we may use web beacons, which are single-pixel, electronic images embedded in the Service that allow us to gather information about your browsing activities on the Service.

Most internet browsers automatically accept cookies. However, you can instruct your internet browser to block cookies or to provide you with a warning prompt before you accept cookies from the Service. Please refer to your internet browser’s instructions to learn more about these functions. If you reject cookies, the functionality of the Service may be limited and you may not be able to participate in several of the Service’s features.

RPC Logging Practices: For a given relay request (e.g., API Request + Metadata), we collect the following information:

— Google Cloud Region for the API Gateway where the request originated from POKT blockchain application public key that was used to facilitate the relay into our network
— Node in the decentralized network that serviced the relay
— Blockchain to which the request was sent
— HTTP response status code of the request after it was processed
— Blockchain method called by the request

### From Third Party Services

We may collect PII about you from third parties whose privacy practices may differ from the practices described in this Policy. We do not make any representations or warranties concerning, and will not in any way be liable for, any informational content, products, services, software, or other materials available through third parties. Your use of third parties’ services and/or third party websites is governed by and subject to the terms and conditions of those third parties and/or third party websites. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies and statements of such third parties and/or third party websites.

### How We Use Information

We may use Users’ PII for lawful business purposes: (i) as necessary for the performance of our contract with Users, (ii) for our legitimate interests, so long as they are not overridden by Users’ own rights and interests, or (iii) as required by law. These purposes include:

### Delivery of the Services

We may use your PII to deliver our services to you through the Service.

### Logging for All Endpoints

The information collected for relay requests are collected to ensure quality of the service across our gateways and network. The data is strictly for internal use only and we will never sell this information to third parties. We may use this data to, for example, quickly debug issues with a given node in our network, a given chain we support, or given methods we see users attempting to use that our network may/may not support. For the private RPC endpoints, which are vendored directly through the Portal, we use Auth0 as our identity-broker for our app/account-owners, and a third party processor for payments. In this manner, we can tie an endpoint to an app/account-owner, meter it them for relay usage of their dApp(s), and charge them appropriately.

### Monitoring Sales and Marketing

We may use your PII to send marketing and promotional materials related to the Service that may interest you. You have the right to opt-out of receiving direct marketing.

### Customer Service and User Communications

We may use your PII to help us respond to your inquiries, questions, requests, and support needs more efficiently.

### User Experience Personalization

We may use Users’ PII and/or Deidentified Information in the aggregate to analyze Users’ browsing and usage activities and patterns in order to understand Users’ interests and preferences with respect to the Service and our services. This will help us optimize your experience on the Service.

### Business Optimization

We may use your PII and/or Deidentified Information to improve the content on our web pages, to customize the content and layout of our web pages, and in managing our everyday business needs. We may also use your feedback to improve the Service and develop new services. All of this is done with the intention of making the Service more useful for you.

### Safety and Security

We may use your PII and/or Deidentified Information to promote the safety and security of the Service, our users, and other parties. For example, we may use the information to authenticate users, facilitate secure payments, protect against fraud and abuse, respond to a legal request or claim, conduct audits, and enforce our terms and policies.

We will not collect additional categories of PII or use PII we collected for materially different, unrelated, or incompatible purposes without providing you notice.

### How We Disclose Information

We may disclose Users’ PII to third parties for a business purpose as described below. Otherwise, we do not sell, rent, lease, or “share” PII, and will not disclose Users’ PII to third parties without your permission. The CCPA defines “sharing” as the disclosure of PII for cross-context behavioral advertising.

### To Our Affiliates

We may disclose your PII to affiliates, including companies within Grove.

### To Service Providers

We may disclose your PII to third party service providers that assist us in providing user support, communicating with Users, and promoting our services, as well as third party service providers that provide other services to us relating to our services and/or the Service.

Law Enforcement, Safety, and Legal Processes: We may disclose your PII to law enforcement or other government officials if it relates to a criminal investigation or alleged criminal activity. We may also disclose your PII: (i) if required or permitted to do so by law; (ii) for fraud protection and credit risk reduction purposes; (iii) in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to protect our rights, interests, or property; (iv) in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to protect your safety or the safety of others; or (v) to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, subpoena, or other similar legal or administrative process.

Sale or Acquisition of Assets: If we become involved in a transaction involving the sale of our assets, such as a merger or acquisition, or if we are transferred to another company, we may disclose and/or transfer your PII as part of the transaction. If the surviving entity in that transaction is not us, the surviving company may use your PII pursuant to its own privacy policies, and those policies may be different from this Policy.

### Type of Information Disclosed

In the last twelve (12) months, we have disclosed the following categories of PII to third parties for a lawful business purpose:

Identifiers; Internet or Other Similar Network Activities; and Geolocation Data.

### Security

‍
The security and confidentiality of your PII is very important to us. We use commercially reasonable security measures to protect your PII on the Service. However, no data transmitted over or accessible through the internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we attempt to protect your PII, we cannot guarantee or warrant that your PII will be completely secure (i) from misappropriation by hackers or from other nefarious or criminal activities, or (ii) in the event of a failure of computer hardware, software, or a telecommunications networks.

### Data Retention

We will retain Users’ PII (including Sensitive PII, where applicable) while they maintain an account with us or to the extent necessary to provide the services through the Service. Thereafter, we will keep PII for as long as reasonably necessary: (i) to respond to any queries from Users; (ii) to demonstrate we treated Users fairly; (iii) for ordinary business continuity procedures; or (iv) to comply with any applicable laws. We delete PII within a reasonable period after we no longer need the information for the purposes set out in this Policy.

### Additional California Privacy Rights

California’s “Shine the Light” law permits Users of the Service that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of PII to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please contact us at the Contact Information provided below.

### Verifiable Consumer Requests

You can exercise your legal rights by submitting a Verifiable Consumer Request to us by emailing us at social@grove.city.

Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a Verifiable Consumer Request related to your PII. Making a Verifiable Consumer Request does not require you to create an account with us. You may only make a Verifiable Consumer Request for access to PII twice in a 12-month period.

The Verifiable Consumer Request must:

Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative; andDescribe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.We cannot respond to your request or provide you with PII if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the PII relates to you. We will only use PII provided in a Verifiable Consumer Request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.

We will acknowledge receipt of a Verifiable Consumer Request within ten (10) days. We endeavor to respond to Verifiable Consumer Requests within thirty (30) days (for data subjects located in the EEA) or forty-five (45) days (for California residents) of its receipt. If we require more time (up to ninety (90) days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the Verifiable Consumer Request’s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.

We do not charge a fee to process or respond to Verifiable Consumer Requests, unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.

### Withdraw Consent

Generally, we do not process PII based on consent. However, in the event we do, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of the processing based on said consent before its withdrawal.

To deliver the services through the Service, it may be necessary for us to share data subjects’ PII outside the EAA or your country of residence. We may share data subject PII with our affiliates and services providers located in the United States. In the event we transfer PII outside the EEA or your country of residence, we will take commercially reasonable measures to ensure the transfer complies with applicable data protection laws and PII is securely transferred. Our standard practice is to use standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission, the UK Information Commissioner’s Office, and other relevant data protection authorities to facilitate such data transfers. If you have any questions about our data transfer practices, please contact us at the Contact Information provided below.
