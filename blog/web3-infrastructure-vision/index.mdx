  Most of global RPC and blockchain infrastructure traffic will settle on permissionless
  protocols.
</Blockquote>

At Grove, we think about this everyday. We have a unique vantage point being the first and largest RPC provider built on a permissionless network. The signals are clear:

RPC providers, and other independent companies, are choosing to operate their own gateways on Pocket, or settle their traffic through Grove, rather than run all of their own nodes.
Many Pocket Network community members want to operate their own gateways.
New decentralized RPC networks have launched in the last year.
Many companies and projects are exploring the value of decentralized node networks as they push up against cost and scalability hurdles. We have the ability to serve the infinite number of permutations that web3 developers need by virtue of building Grove on Pocket Network.

### The trend is clear — web3 infrastructure will be decentralized.

In our experience contributing to Pocket Network and building Grove, we know the path to decentralization for any project is not simple. A lot of effort goes into understanding and coordinating demand and supply for one chain, let alone many. Web3 technology changes at a pace not seen in many industries, adding further complexity. Many projects can’t afford the time and resources to do this R&D regularly, let alone the opportunity cost of not focusing on their core products.

  Our mission at Grove is to make it as easy as possible for any gateway provider, or
  project, to build on top of Pocket Network.
</Blockquote>

With Grove providing the foundational connectivity through Pocket Network, our partners are free to focus on the features that their customers truly care about. To achieve this, our top priority is to build a product that is a reliable, performant and cost effective option for any provider in the RPC space. Our key areas of focus have been to provide a user-friendly platform and to build a quality of service (QoS) layer on top of the decentralized node network. The QoS layer has been particularly tricky as we have to ensure the many flavors of user requests are matched to the appropriate node, all while minimizing latency and maximizing throughput (relays per second).

Our hard work has paid off. We’re processing tens of thousands of relays a second and we’re passing customer performance tests with ease. Our pricing is easy to understand and highly competitive.

We are proving that it is possible to build a real business on top of a decentralized protocol.

### The proof is in the relationships we have with our customers and partners:

- [Aave](https://aave.com/), a decentralized non-custodial liquidity market protocol
- [APY.vision](https://apy.vision/), a data platform for DeFi investors and protocols
- [Arcadia](https://arcadia.agency/), a software security and product development company
- [Biconomy](https://www.biconomy.io/), a developer toolkit for account abstraction
- [Infura](https://www.infura.io/), a web3 infrastructure platform
- [OnFinality](https://onfinality.io/), a web3 infrastructure and developer tooling platform
- [OpenOcean](https://openocean.finance/), a DEX aggregator and DeFi trading platform
- [Scroll](https://scroll.io/), a layer 2 network on Ethereum, zkEVM

All these companies, and many more, see the value in partnering with a proven gateway to decentralized RPC.

It’s been a long road building to this level, driven by people who deeply believe in a decentralized multi-chain future. As the leaders in delivering decentralized RPC, there is no playbook for getting to where we have. We don’t brag about things until we see them through the finish line — this is one of those moments for us.

The work we’ve done gives us the best view of the multichain, multi gateway future and we’re out in front, planning for the needs of tomorrow.
